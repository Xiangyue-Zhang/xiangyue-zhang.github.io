Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to Xiangyue ZHANG (ç« æ¹˜ç²µ) Page. Iâ€™m a first-year M.Sc. at HAVPR Lab(Human Activity & Visual Perception Research Lab) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Zhigang Tu](http://tuzhigang.cn/index.html). My M.Sc. research interests mainly focus on Skeleton motion recognition, 3D virtual human, motion capture, and 3D vision.

I graduated with an B.Eng from the [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) in 2023 with the honours degree and outstanding student award. I also majored in Date Science and big data Technology, where I became interested in computer vision and learned about skeleton motion recognition and human posture estimation. Because of my undergraduate performance, I was recommended to study for a master's degree in computer application technology at Wuhan University.
